# Burgatory ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

Burgatory is your one stop digital ordering interface. Hand crafted for Burgatory, a proudly rustic dining establishment, the app allows a customer to create an order, mark it devoured, then trash it. Responses and information are logged to a SQL database, making it easier than ever to keep track of what is being eaten. Powered by Javascript, node, handlebars, and SQL, Burgatory is clean, powerful, delicious fun.
